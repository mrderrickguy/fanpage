		<center><p>I choose these three artist's because of their unique style of music and the message the convey through their lyrics.


		   Due to their christain beliefs, they produce a more positive and uplifting type of sound and all the while, doing so without all the profanity you might hear being pushed through songs of the more "mainsteam " rap artist's these days.

		   So while by myself, at home, or in my car I can play thier music and not worry about exposing my kids to words I wouldn't want them using or hearing lyrics encouraging them to do things I wouldn't approve of. </p></center>

		<div>
		
		<center><p><strong><em>Derek Minor-</em></strong> Derek Johnson, Jr., better known by his stage name Derek Minor and former stage name PRo, (born December 16, 1984) is an American Christian hip hop artist, record producer, entrepreneur, actor, and screenwriter. He co-founded the hip-hop record label Reflection Music Group (RMG) with Doc Watson, and signed to Reach Records in a joint venture between the two labels in 2011. In 2012, Johnson announced that he had changed his stage name from Pro to Derek Minor. In 2014, he announced that as his two-album contract with Reach was complete, he would no longer be publishing releases through that label.</p></center>

		<center><p><strong><em>Bizzle-</em></strong> Mark Julian Felder,[1] (born July 21, 1983), more commonly known under the mononym Bizzle, is an American Christian hip hop recording artist and entrepreneur. Previously referred to as Playboy,[citation needed] and Lavyss.
		In January 2010, Bizzle released "You Got Some Explaining to Do" directed towards Jay-Z, calling the rap icon out on his negative references towards Jesus and Christianity in his music. The video caused much controversy and generated a buzz that even Bizzle couldn't anticipate. He released a statement in an interview with AllHipHop.com.[2]</p></center>

			<center><p><strong><em>Lecrae-</em></strong> Lecrae Devaughn Moore (born October 9, 1979), mononymously known as Lecrae, is an American Christian hip hop recording artist, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label Reach Records, and the co-founder and president of the now-defunct non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries. To date, he has released seven studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, and one EP as the leader of the hip hop group 116 Clique. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to his label as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records in a joint deal between his label and Columbia.</p></center>
